This is a simple program which first detects smile, and then clicks a picture as soon as it is detected.
It is written in Python 3.7

Modules required:
    1. cv2 (OpenCV)
    2. datetime

This program uses trackbars to pass the critical values in the function which detects the smile. Therefore the user can adjust the values thereby forcing the program to detect the smile, if not detected on its own
